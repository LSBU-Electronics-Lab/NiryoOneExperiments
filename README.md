###Final Task

(a)	Place a block in pre pick up position for block A about 5mm above the block. This allow a perpendicular path for the gripper when going down to the block as shown in the image below. Record the x,y,z,r,y,p coordinates in a spreadsheet, The gripper position should be as in this picture with the servo motor facing left.

(b)	Take a measurement for pickup position block A and record the coordinates in your table.

(c)	Place a block on top of block A and take a pre pickup position coordinate and record the values 

(d)	Record a pickup position coordinate for the second block as below, at about the middle of the block.

(e)	Record a pre pick position coordinate for the third block in position A and a pickup coordinate and record it in your table.

(f)	Repeat taking pre pickup and pickup measurements for position B by using the same 3 blocks. Start with one block as in position A and add the other blocks after recording the coordinates.

(g)	Repeat taking pre pickup and pickup measurements for position C by using the same 3 blocks. Start with one block as in position A and add the other blocks after recording the coordinates.

(h)	Create a program to automate block positioning and stacking, keeping track of the blocks in each position. Use the coordinates recorded in your table to position the robot to pick up blocks. The program must follow the basic steps detailed below to ensure the blocks are grabbed without damaging the robot gripper. 

(i)	The robot should remain ready at the Initial position which is perpendicularly above positions A,B,C at a distance which does not interfere with the blocks as shown in the image below. This starting position should also be recorded in your table with the LAB 4 program so it can be implemented at the start of the block stacking program.


###Initial position
 
ii)	One block should rest in each position A, B , C on start
iii)	An input should be read, and the robot arm should be positioned in pre pickup position
iv)	The robot should go down and pick up the block
v)	(Important) The robot should move up perpendicular to the block positionfor about 2cm 
vi)	Then go back to the Initial position holding the block
vii)	An input should be read from the keyboard to select the new position on top of another block 
viii)	The program should keep track of the number of blocks stack at each position
ix)	The program should be able to stack 3 blocks at any position A, B or C
